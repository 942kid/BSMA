Maybe I should get tired of make sloppy useless plot and have something really serious. But it seems too quick to quit at the third one. What a shame. I did learn a lot and had lots of fun. But after all, it not a job, not to mention a career. I'd better take sometime to rethink what I should do with coding in R.
